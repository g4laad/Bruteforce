# Bruteforce

Collection of personnal tools for bruteforce attacks.

The idea is to be full automated and the script bruteforce_launcher.sh does this job.

The bruteforce_launcher.sh need all the files (not the john_to_dico.py and curtom_list.py)
If you us it, you'll need to rewrite all the paths in the bash scripts but also configure the python scripts for your own use.

However you can use those scripts alone.
