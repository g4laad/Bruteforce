# Bruteforce

Collection of personnal tools for bruteforce attacks.

The idea is to be fully automated and the script bruteforce_launcher.sh does this job.

The bruteforce_launcher.sh need all the files (not the john_to_dico.py and custom_list.py)
If you use it, you'll need to rewrite all the paths in the bash scripts but also configure the python scripts for your own use.

However you can use those scripts alone.
